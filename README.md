# Rotary Encoder Breakout Boards

Breakout boards for use with the [Bourns PEC09-series rotary encoders](https://www.bourns.com/data/global/pdfs/pec09.pdf) (encoder + push switch).

Also includes an adapter board to interface with an Arduino. Architecture allows CAT5 daisy-chaining of multiple encoders off a single control line. The RotaryEncoder\_8Ch\_Selectable layout includes an LED indicator as to which channel is "activated." Useful, eg, for controlling a DAC.
